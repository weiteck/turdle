* Large-font gameboard reminiscent of the original game
* Animated letter reveals and invalid word feedback
* 'Keyboard' showing the state of each letter you've used

### ‚å®Ô∏è Special Keys
* Use <kbd>Tab</kbd> to toggle the keyboard layout or set `TURDLE_QWERTY_MODE=1` to start with QWERTY layout
* Use <kbd>Page Up</kbd> and <kbd>Page Down</kbd> to cycle the background colour
* Use <kbd>Home</kbd> to reset the background colour

## Installation
Linux and Windows binaries are available on the [releases](https://github.com/weiteck/turdle/releases) page.

Alternatively, if you have Rust [installed](https://rustup.rs), you can install by running:
```
cargo install turdle --locked
```
If you encounter a missing linker error, your system may be missing the required compiler toolchain:

_Arch_
```
sudo pacman -S base-devel
```

_Debian/Ubuntu_
```
sudo apt install build-essential
```

_Centos_
```
sudo yum install gcc
````
### Compatibility
Testing has been on modern terminal emulators. The large font rendering may not work on Windows command prompt or Powershell, but should work on later versions of [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal).
